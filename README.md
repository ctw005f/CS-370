Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
  **For this project, I was given a starter code along with a sample environment and was asked to develop a deep q learning algorithm in order to navigate a priate through a maze to a treasure.**
Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
    **Computer scientists are the back bone of technology. A computer scientist can work in a vast array of tech relatied fields such as cyber security and computer programming. They can also work and a variety of different workloads such as databased, AI, web development, and app development to list a few examples. Their primary job is to use computers to make task simple and easy for end users.**
  How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
    **As a computer scientist, I approach problems in a liquid way meaning I do not approach any one problem the same as another.**
  What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
    **My ethical responsibilites to the end user and the organization are to keep data secure and to prevent any bias from entering my work.**
